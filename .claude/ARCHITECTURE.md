# OpaaxEngine — Architecture Contract

> **What this file is.** The *positive* statement of the engine's load-bearing invariants — the rules
> I check every change against. `lessons.md` holds the *negative* record (mistakes + why). This holds
> the *contract*. Read both at session start.
>
> **Rule IDs (`I1`, `L1`, `S1`…) are citable.** In review I say "violates **I1**" instead of re-arguing it.
> If a change must break an invariant here, that is a STOP-and-re-plan trigger (CLAUDE.md §1) — we amend
> this file deliberately, we don't drift past it.
>
> **Scope:** the *new* engine (branch `refresh_engine`). The old world (`CoreEngineApp`, `*Old` classes,
> `EventOld/`) is dead-but-compiled — see **X1**. When code and this file disagree, the code wins *and you
> fix this file in the same change*.

## I — Prime invariants (non-negotiable)

**I1 — One static root.** `OpaaxApplication::m_Services` (a `static AppServiceLocator`) is the *only*
mutable static in the engine. Everything else is instance-owned beneath it: the locator owns the services
(`UniquePtr<IAppService>`), the `IEngine` service owns the `EngineSubsystemMgr`, the manager owns the
subsystems. No `s_Data`, no function-local `static`, no singletons past the locator. This is the invariant
the whole design optimizes (see **L2**); a proposal that adds a static is wrong by default, even a "clean" one.
*The old static `RenderCommand`/`IRenderAPI` facade was **retired to `Legacy/RHI`** (2026-07-22, [[L14]]) —
the render path is now instance-owned via `IRHIDevice` (`RenderSystem::m_Device`), zero facade statics; do not resurrect it.*

**I2 — DLL-safe type identity.** A type's tag must be a *single instance across the DLL/exe boundary*.
Two proven ways to get that — the deciding factor is **whether the tag is dll-exported**, not inline-vs-`.cpp`:
- **Out-of-line (services):** `OPAAX_SERVICE_TYPE(IFoo)` *declares* `StaticTypeID()` in the header; the
  interface's `.cpp` *defines* it. One tag, shared. `ServiceTypeID = uintptr_t`.
- **Exported-inline (subsystems):** `OPAAX_SUBSYSTEM_TYPE` keeps `StaticTypeID()` inline (a function-local
  static). It is still single-instance *because the subsystem class is `OPAAX_API`* — dllimport imports the
  one exported inline definition into the exe rather than re-emitting it. **Proven by S9 (2026-07-20):**
  `GetSubsystem<WorldManager>()` is non-null across the exe/DLL line (DLL-side instance tag == exe-side
  `StaticTypeID()`, same address). So I2 is *not* "out-of-line only" — it is "one exported tag."
- The "duplicates per module" hazard (**L4**) bites only a tag that is **not** dll-exported: a header-only
  template static, or a subsystem living in a **static lib / game module** (M4). Such a type must go
  out-of-line (service shape) or be exported. If `GetSubsystem<T>()` across the boundary ever returns null,
  this is the first suspect.
- New cross-module identity must hash a compiler-stable per-type string (`__FUNCSIG__`), never a
  template-static counter.

**I3 — Resolution never returns null.** `AppServiceLocator::Get<T>()` returns `T::Null()` (an inert null
object), never `nullptr`. Every service interface provides `static T& Null()` + `IsNull()`. Callers may use
a service unconditionally; they check `IsNull()` only when absence is a *real* branch. Do not add
null-pointer checks around `Get<T>()`.

**I4 — Gregory layer split decides App vs Engine.** Before placing any system, name its layer in Gregory's
runtime diagram (Fig 1.16):
- **App service** = Platform-Independence + Core-Systems layers — *passive facilities* you submit-to/query:
  Platform, Paths, Logger, Config, ProjectManager, JobSystem, WindowManager. They do not tick.
- **Engine** = Resources/Assets layer *and up* — anything that ticks per frame or owns game concepts
  (Resources, Renderer, World, Physics, Input). Lives as an `EngineSubsystem`, never as an app service.
- Test: *ticks per frame or knows about textures/worlds* ⇒ engine. *Passive facility* ⇒ app service.
  (See **L1**.) `IEngine` is itself an app service — a deliberate exception that serves **I1**, not a
  counter-example to this rule.

**I5 — Ownership follows lifetime, top-down.** Four tiers, each owned by the one above, destroyed
bottom-up: `static locator → app services → IEngine → engine subsystems`. A subsystem never owns a
sibling; it *borrows* one by resolving from the manager (**F3**). Convenience pointers to siblings are
non-owning, initialised `= nullptr`, and re-resolved, never `delete`d.

**I6 — Never dll-export a class *template*; stateless value types are header-only.**
`__declspec(dllexport/dllimport)` (`OPAAX_API`) on a class *template* exports nothing — a template is not
code until instantiated, so marking it `dllimport` makes every consumer expect the instantiation *from the
DLL*, which never exports it → **LNK2019** (proven 2026-07-20: the `Angle` module linked from the editor exe
against the engine DLL). Two correct shapes:
- **Header-only value template** — `TFloatValue`, `TDegree`/`TRadian`/`TAngle`, math vectors: **no
  `OPAAX_API`.** Instantiated per-TU; DLL-safe *by construction* — no shared state, no vtable, no identity
  tag to unify (the opposite end of the axis from **I2**: identity/export matter only for types with shared
  state or a cross-module tag; a stateless value has neither). Out-of-line member defs go in a `.inl` that
  is **`#include`d where the type is declared**, or they're unresolved too.
- **Explicit instantiation** (only to hide a body / cut bloat): `template class OPAAX_API TFoo<float>;` in a
  DLL `.cpp` + `extern template class OPAAX_API TFoo<float>;` in the header. Overkill for a solo 2D engine's
  small value types (project value **Simple**) — prefer header-only.
`OPAAX_API` belongs on **non-template** classes with real compiled members (services, the `Maths` static
struct, `Engine`), never on the template itself.

## LC — Lifecycle: three states, not two

The engine has **three** states, and the middle one is the doctrine that keeps cleanup correct (**L7**):

| State | When | Guarantee | What may run here |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Running** | the frame loop | everything live | Update / FixedUpdate / Render / Present |
| **TearDown** | loop stopped, nothing destroyed yet | window, GPU, bus, **all siblings still alive** | release anything that needs a *live sibling*; broadcast "X-ending" events |
| **Shutdown** | reverse-order destruction via locator | siblings may **already be gone** | free only your *own* resources; never reach out |

**LC1 — The missing-phase rule.** If a cleanup problem has no good answer inside the phases you have, the
fix is usually a *new phase*, not defensive code in a destructor. The real axis is **"all alive" vs
"things dying"** — no reordering *inside* Shutdown can fake TearDown. This is one doctrine at every scope:
`ISubsystem::TearDown` / `IEngine::TearDown` / `OpaaxApplication::EngineTeardown`. Two-phase events wear
the same hat: broadcast `XCreated` *after* init, `XDestroying` *before* deinit.

**LC2 — Teardown-time events use `Publish`, not `Enqueue`.** The queue is flushed inside `Loop()`, which
has already stopped by TearDown; an *enqueued* teardown event is never delivered. Bridge it with `Publish`.

**LC3 — Idempotent + reverse order.** Startup is registration order; Shutdown/TearDown are reverse.
`Shutdown` is idempotent. The `IEngine` service is provided **last** in Bootstrap, so it tears down
**first** — before the window/GPU context dies.

---

## BO — Boot order (app services, in `Bootstrap()`)

Provided into the locator in strict dependency order — do not reorder without cause:

```
Platform → Paths → Logger(Paths) → Config(Paths)+PreRegisterConfig
        → ProjectManager(Paths) → JobSystem → WindowManager → Engine → OnProvideServices()
```

**BO1** — Config is loaded from disk here, *before* the Engine exists. JobSystem comes *after* Config
(worker count is config-driven). (See **L1**.)
**BO2** — The Engine service is **constructed** in `Bootstrap` (pre-window) but **started**
(`Engine().Startup()`) later, in `EngineStartup()`, *after* the window exists.
*(This supersedes L1's note that IEngine is created post-window — it is created in Bootstrap, started post-window.)*
**BO3** — The **window** is created in `InitializeApplication()`, not Bootstrap — it needs a live GL/VK context.
`WindowManager` (the service) is booted in Bootstrap; the window object comes later.

**Full frame of the run:**
`Bootstrap() → InitializeApplication() [window] → RunApplication{ EngineStartup → loop → EngineTeardown } → ShutdownApplication()`

---

## F — Frame contract

**F1 — Tick order** (`IEngine`, driven by the host): `Update(dt)` → `FixedUpdate(fixedDt)` *[may run 0..N
times]* → `Render(alpha)`. Then the **host** calls `Present()` — outside the engine. Delta is clamped to
`MAX_FRAME_DELTA = 0.25`.

**F2 — Present is split from Render (render north star, S7/D2).** `Render` draws; `Present` swaps. The
**host owns WHEN** (`RunApplication` calls `Engine().Present()` after `TickFrame()`); the **device owns
HOW**. Only the backbuffer is ever presented; offscreen render targets never are. This gap is what lets the
editor draw world→FBO, UI→backbuffer, then present once. Present is instance-based (no statics — **I1**).
- **M1 target shape:** `BeginFrame / BeginPass(target,view) / EndPass / EndFrame / Present`. "scene" is
  retired vocabulary — a render *pass into a target with a view*. New render path is **OpenGL-only** today;
  the VK backend is **parked in `Legacy/RHI/Vulkan`** (2026-07-22) pending a new-path `VulkanRHIDevice`.

**F3 — A subsystem needing a sibling mid-boot resolves from the manager.** During its own `Startup`, a
subsystem reaches a sibling via `m_Subsystems.GetSubsystem<T>()` (the manager's create-pass populates the
list before any `Startup` runs) — **never** via a lazy accessor that can re-enter the owner's boot. Doing
the latter causes the per-frame re-init loop of **L6**.

---

## SE — Extension seams (composition-root-only)

Only a **composition root** (an `OpaaxApplication` subclass — `Sandbox`, `EditorApplication`) overrides
these. A *service* or a *panel* never touches the locator (D3). Base implementations are silent no-ops, so
not overriding them leaves runtime byte-identical.

| Seam | Fires | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `CreatePaths()` | in `BootPaths` (Bootstrap) | choose the `IPaths` impl (runtime `Paths` vs `EditorPaths`) |
| `PreRegisterConfig()` | in Bootstrap | register config types before load |
| `OnProvideServices(locator)` | end of Bootstrap | add host-owned app services (editor adds `IEditorService`) |
| `PreEngineStartup()` | start of `EngineStartup` | before subsystems start |
| `RegisterModules(registrar)` | in `EngineStartup`, registries exist, **no world yet** | route the game module — drives `IRuntimeModule::OnRegister` (**MR**) |
| `OnModulesRegistered()` | in `EngineStartup`, **after** `OnRegisterModules`, **before** `Engine().Startup()` (still no world) | editor registers its D10 extensions and **seals before the first world** (§2). `EditorApplication` overrides → `EditorService::RegisterExtensions`, which drives each `IEditorModule::OnRegister(EditorExtensionRegistrar&)`. Generic engine-side name (no editor types) — the engine stays editor-ignorant (**D4**). |
| `PostEngineStartup()` | end of `EngineStartup` | after subsystems start (editor inits `EditorService`) |
| `TickFrame()` | per loop iter | base = `Engine().Loop()`; editor wraps it UI-begin → Loop → UI-end |
| `OnEvent(event)` | window callback, per event | base = app sink (close/resize→bus); `EditorApplication` overrides → `EditorService::RouteInput` first (S11), so the editor sees events before the bus |

---

## MR — Module registration (D9)

A game module is an **`IRuntimeModule`** (`Application/IRuntimeModule.h`); its `OnRegister` registers
**into** a `ModuleRegistrar`, invoked by the host's `RegisterModules` seam before any world exists:
```cpp
InRegistrar.Components().Register<TransformComponent>();      // → ComponentRegistry v2 (M3)
InRegistrar.WorldSubsystems().Register<WaveSpawnSubsystem>(); // → WorldSubsystemRegistry (M4)
```
**MR1** — The call-site API is **final now**; only the route *bodies* change (M0 counts; M3/M4 forward to
real registries). Do not change how modules call in.
**MR2** — Order is engine natives → game module → editor module → **seal** (before the first world). The
editor module slots in before the seal.
**MR3 — One module shape.** Runtime and editor modules share a marker base **`IModule`**
(`Application/IModule.h`): `IRuntimeModule : IModule` (`OnRegister(ModuleRegistrar&)`) and
`IEditorModule : IModule` (`OnRegister(EditorExtensionRegistrar&)`). `OnRegister` stays on each derived
interface — the two register into *different* registrars, so it can't sit on the base. All three are
header-only pure interfaces, **no `OPAAX_API`** (no exported symbols / shared state / identity tag — the
opposite end of the axis from **I2**). A host invokes a module as a throwaway instance
(`SandboxModule().OnRegister(reg)`), symmetric across runtime and editor.

---

## X — Old/new coexistence

**X1 — The old world is quarantined in `Engine/Source/Legacy/` and dropped from the build (2026-07-19).**
`CoreEngineApp`, every `*Old` type, `EventOld/`, the old `Scene/`/`World/`/`ECS/`/`Physics/` trees, the old
editor (`Engine/Source/Editor/`), the old subsystems (`Core/Systems/{GameSubsystem,MoverSubsystem,
PhysicsSubsystem,Movement}`), the old renderer (`Camera/` controllers, `Pass/`, `Systems/WorldRenderSystem`,
`RenderSubsystem`), and the static `RenderCommand` path — all live under `Engine/Source/Legacy/`, **NOT globbed
by the engine DLL** (compiled = zero). Their old-world tests live in `Engine/Tests/Legacy/`. **Do not add new
dependencies on any of it, and do not re-glob `Legacy/`.** It will be deleted; anything you hang off it dies with
it. *(Exception: `Core/Systems/Subsystem.h` — `ISubsystem`/`ISubsystemManager` — stayed LIVE; it is the base of
the new `EngineSubsystemBase`.)* Next: Gregory-layer the live remainder (plan `inherited-orbiting-clover.md`).
**X2 — New systems get collision-proof identities up front.** When old and new coexist, the *new* type gets
a scoped `enum class` / distinct name — never rely on include order or forward-decl tricks to avoid a
clash. Two unscoped enums sharing enumerator names collide the moment one TU needs both (**L4**).
**X3 — A rename to `*Old` carries through to enumerators and consumers**, not just the type name.

---

## PL — Placing a new system (decision procedure)

1. **Name its Gregory layer** (**I4**). Passive facility ⇒ app service. Ticks / owns game concepts ⇒ engine subsystem.
2. **App service?** interface + `OPAAX_SERVICE_TYPE` (out-of-line `.cpp` — **I2**), `Null()`/`IsNull()`
   (**I3**), provided in `Bootstrap` at the right dependency point (**BO**), torn down reverse.
3. **Engine subsystem?** `EngineSubsystemBase` + `OPAAX_SUBSYSTEM_TYPE`, registered with `EngineSubsystemMgr`,
   implement `Startup`/`TearDown`/`Shutdown` honoring **LC**; borrow siblings via **F3**.
4. **Ownership** follows lifetime (**I5**); **no new static** (**I1**).
5. **Simplicity gate:** does a mid-sized indie engine really need this now? Simple > clever
   (project value #1). If a premise balloons past its sketch, STOP and surface a scoped fork with a
   recommendation (**L3**) — don't build the expensive version unseen.

---

## CH — Change protocol (how we work; full text in CLAUDE.md)

- **Build truth:** `./build.bat` ends with `OPAAX_BUILD_OK` / `OPAAX_BUILD_FAIL` and a real exit code.
  Grep the marker; never trust "looks done." `build.bat fast [target]` = seconds-long incremental check.
- **Forks up front:** surface the 2–3 real scope/premise forks *during planning*, with a recommendation,
  decide once, then build the decided version. Most back-and-forth in `lessons.md` is a fork found mid-build.
- **Gates:** every milestone step has a demo gate + unit-test gate. A red build right after your change is
  not proof your change broke it — `git status` shows your true blast radius (**L5**).
- **Perf is a gate, not a vibe:** hot-path systems (bullets, sprites, bodies) carry a *loose* perf budget.
  Bench cases live in `Engine/Tests/Perf/` as a doctest suite `"perf"` marked `skip()` — they never run in
  `build.bat test`/CI (unit baseline stays 106/426). Run RELEASE via **`./build.bat bench`**. Soft gate:
  budgets catch algorithmic/allocation regressions (O(n²), per-op alloc), NOT micro-noise; watch the printed
  ns/op yourself for ~2× drift. Helper: `Engine/Tests/Perf/PerfBench.h` (median-of-epochs, homegrown — a
  loose gate doesn't need nanobench). Add a case → add its path to `Engine/Tests/CMakeLists.txt` (explicit list).

## Pointers

- **Post-mortems / rules:** `.claude/lessons.md` (L1–L8).
- **Live session state:** `.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` (current milestone, standing decisions).
- **Working checklist:** `.claude/task/todo.md`.
- **Ground truth for engine design:** `.claude/data/` — *Game Engine Architecture* (Gregory). Prefer it over
  generic advice.
